# GigaTECH Writing/Business Analyst Challenge

Hi! Thank you for your interest in [GigaTECH][gigatech]. Our hiring process may include a writing challenge. This challenge allows us to gauge your written communication skills. We will follow the challenge up with an interview to discuss what you have submitted.

We appreciate that any research and writing challenge represents an investment of your time. We hope you see the value in having a writing sample that is relatable to both of us for the interview. You should feel free to use the paper you developed for this challenge in any way that you would like.

## The Challenge

One of the challenges we face as technical analysts is the ability to find and consume the appropriate information specific to a task, while disregarding what does not matter at that point in time. This challenge is designed for you to consume information and write a small paper. We will expose you to some of the concepts, technologies, and regulations that we deal with everyday, such as [FHIR &reg;][fhir] and [21st Century Cures Act][21curesact].

[FHIR &reg;][fhir] is becoming a more mainstream technology standard. Government regulations, such as the [21st Century Cures Act][21curesact], are beginning to emerge that require [FHIR &reg;][fhir]. We would like a paper that describes how FHIR supports the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act

Ideally, this would take a couple of hours to complete.
